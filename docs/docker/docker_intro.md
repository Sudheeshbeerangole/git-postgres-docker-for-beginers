# What is Docker?

Docker is a container management service. The keywords of Docker are develop, ship, and run
anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications and ship them.
into containers, which can then be deployed anywhere.

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly.
Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the
software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications in any environment and
know your code will run.

The initial release of Docker was in March 2013 and since then, it has become the buzzword for
modern world development, especially in the face of Agile-based projects.

## Features of Docker

- Docker has the ability to reduce the size of development by providing a smaller footprint of the operating system via containers.

- With containers, it becomes easier for teams across different units, such as development, QA, and Operations to work seamlessly across applications.

- You can deploy Docker containers anywhere, on any physical and virtual machine, and even on the cloud.

- Since Docker containers are pretty lightweight, they are very easily scalable.
